[Data curation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_curation) is the process of organization and integration of [data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data) collected from various sources. It involves transformation and maintentance of the data within a data lake. In the age of big data and datalake when systems generate more and more semi-structured and unstructured data, it is imperative to develope robust architecture for data curation that scales with the growth of the data lake and keeps up with analytics demand of an organization.
